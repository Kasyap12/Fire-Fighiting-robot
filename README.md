# Fire-Fighiting-robot
According to survey in india nearly 25,000 people die every year due to fire and related causes and the loss due to these fire incidents is more than Rs.100 crores. Even though there are lot of precaution taken to prevent the fire there are accidents happening everywhere, so we have to kill the fire before it kills us. In a fire breakout the firefighters are restricted to go near the fire as the intensity of the fire is high in some cases, In order to overcome this we can build an autonomous firefighting robot which can help the firefighters in reducing the heat of the fire.
